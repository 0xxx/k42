<title>K42 Documentation</title>
<h1>K42 Documentation</h1>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/K42/index.html">The K42 web page at 
      IBM T.J. Watson</a>
<li> <a href="LICENSE.html">The K42 License (the GNU LGPL)</a>
</ul>

<p> The majority of documentation in K42 is contained in sgml files in a
subdirectory called "doc" in each source directory.  There are a series of
top-level documents that provide help with getting started on the system
(in the doc directory - one level down from here).  There is a makefile in
each doc directory to make documentation at that level.  Executing a make
world from the top-level doc directory will build all html documentation
throughout the system (other choices are world_ps for postscript and
world_all for both html and postscript).  For convenience of pointers to
many of the html files get built into a file called docPointers in the doc
directory.  </p>

<h3>Papers</h3>

<p> 
There are a series of technical white papers in the doc/white-papers
directory.  The white-papers have been targetted at specific aspects of K42
with a particular focus on discussing why particular design decisions were
made.  These and other papers targetted at conferences can be found on the
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/K42/index.html"> K42 </a> home page.

<h3>Getting started on the system</h3>

There are a couple of documents useful in starting to work with K42.  The
below links are to the doc directory and require a make in that directory
before the links will work.  However, all the files are human readable and
can be edited with any standard text editor.

This repository of the K42 Project is provided for research and
educational purposes.  It is not supported nor is it expected to build
or run without some effort.

There are two branches:
  - kitchsrc: Initial snapshot of a K42 checkout of 2005-09-08 from
              IBM supplied by Amos Waterland.
  - master:   Some additional work from various non-IBMers

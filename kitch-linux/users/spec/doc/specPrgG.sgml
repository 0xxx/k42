	  Login to a running K42 machine, or localhost

  <para>
    This will run a single run sequence. Basically the first time you run
    it it will clone a directory per virtual user, this takes the longest
    amount of time. The it will run the benchmark. Subsequent runs will
    reuse the directory skipping th cloning part altogether.

	  The following will run the sequence as <option>n</option>
	  users:

	  You may also have the benchmark run many times with a various
	  amount of users:
	  <screen>
	    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make -f M.k42 RUNSERIES="1 4 16 32 64 128"</userinput>
	  </screen>
	  This will run the benchmark 6 times with 1, 4, 16, 32, 64,
	  128 simultaneous users, respectively.

	<para>
	  The following will run a series of SDET benchmarks, after
	  configuring the system to run from ramfs, and optimizing
	  run-time kernel parameters.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Run the following from the build host:
	  <screen>
	    <prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>sdetPrep <option>kitchroot-path</option> <option>image-name</option></userinput>
	  </screen>
	  kitchroot-path is the path to the kitchroot that you are
	  running with.  This will create an archive of the selected
	  kitchroot called "image-name" (which will reside in the
	  kitchroot directory).
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  From the login shell run /nfs/home/spec/bin/runSDET (use the
	  -h option to see usage information.  Defaults for all
	  options can be specified through environment variables.

	  This will prepare ramfs (populating it with the files from
	  the archive created in the step above), bind
	  ramfs to / hide the nfs mount (it can only be accessed via
	  /nfs afterwards), then run the SDET benchmark with the
	  specified RUNSERIES arguments.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  During each of these runs the kernel will be automatically
	  tuned for optimal performance, however tracing parameters
	  are by default not affected.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If the environment variable SDETTRACE is set in the login
	  shell (or via the -t option), the trace mask will be set to
	  that value for the duration of the benchmark.  If this is
	  the case, upon completion of the benchmark the trace mask
	  will be set to 0x10000.  The SDETTRACE variable should be
	  set to the hex value of the desired trace mask (e.g.,
	  0x30808 -- for hwperf tracing).  (Note, if you don't want
	  tracing, disable it manually.  SDETTRACE is for collecting
	  trace events only during the SDET run, that is it is meant
	  to turn tracing on, rather than to turn it off, since it
	  can't actually turn tracing on/off without side-effects.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  The runSDET script can be run repeatedly (until the system
	  dies), on the second and subsequent runs it will skip the
	  ramfs preparation step.

  <warning>
    <title>Compiler</title>
    <simpara>
      We currently do not have a compiler that runs on k42. The
      benchmark requires an executable binary to drive it. This is
      cross-linked when you build k42 in the this directory.

    <title>Reinstalling</title>
    <para>
      If the benchmark files become corrupt for some reason simply run
      the following commands in the <filename
      class="directory">kitchsrc/kitch-linux/users/spec</filename>
      directory:
      <screen>
	<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make clobber</userinput>
	<prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install_targets</userinput>
      </screen>

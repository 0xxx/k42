    Kitch-linux requires the <envar> KITCH_LINUX </envar> make variable set
    to the directory that contains the installation of glibc, that is the
    directory that contains <filename>include</filename> and
    <filename>lib</filename> subdirectories, this is obtained by default
    from the top level MakePaths.proto makefile. You can override it as

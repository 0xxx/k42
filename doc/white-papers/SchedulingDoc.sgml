  <title>Scheduling in K42</title>

  <abstract>

    <para>
      In K42, responsibility for scheduling is divided between user-level and
      kernel-level code.
      Moving part of the scheduler to user level reduces kernel interaction
      and improves performance.
      Flexibility is increased because applications can tailor the user-level
      part of the scheduler to their own needs.
      K42 was designed from the beginning to support two-level scheduling in
      a multiprocessor environment.

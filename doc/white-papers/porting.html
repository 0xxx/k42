      ABSTRACT
    </CENTER>

    <P>
This note is an attempt to record the useful information that we
have acquired while porting the K42 operating system to the
X86-64 processor.
    <P>
    <HR>


<H1> Notes on Porting K42 </H1>

<p> The K42 group is developing a new high performance,
general-purpose operating system kernel for cache-coherent
multiprocessors. We are targeting next generation servers ranging
from small-scale multiprocessors (which we expect will become
ubiquitous) to very large-scale non-symmetric multiprocessors
that are becoming increasingly important in both commercial and
technical environments.  The K42 operating system is designed to
be compatible with the Linux operating system.  K42 currently
runs on PowerPC and MIPS systems (both native and using SimOS).

<p> One of the processors which we expect to be widespread is the
X86-64 architecture.  It is a clean extension of the common "x86"
architecture to 64 bits.  The x86 processor registers are
extended to 64 bits, and the number of registers is increased to
16.  In addition, memory addresses are extended to 64-bits,
including a 64-bit instruction pointer (rip) and stack pointer
(rsp).  A compatibility mode supports the previous 32-bit 
architecture.

<p> Our task was to port K42 to the X86-64 architecture.


<H2> The Source Tree </H2>

<p>
The first problem is to get access to the K42 source.  The
K42 source tree is stored in CVS, and available from the
CVS server on rios1.watson.ibm.com.  We are able to access
the entire tree using 

<pre>
CVSROOT=:pserver:peterson@rios1.watson.ibm.com:/u/kitchawa/cvsroot
</pre>

Getting a copy of the entire K42 source is then

<pre>
cvs co kitchsrc
</pre>

<p>
The source tree is designed to contain both source code and
documentation, as well as the tools and structure to compile
and link (build) the source code.


<H2> Documentation </H2>

<p> The majority of documentation in K42 is contained in sgml
files in a subdirectory called <tt>doc</tt> in each source
directory.  There are a series of top-level documents that
provide help with getting started on the system (in the
<tt>kitchsrc/doc</tt> directory).  There is a <tt>Makefile</tt>
in each <tt>doc</tt> directory to make documentation at that
level.  Executing a <tt>make world</tt> from the top-level
<tt>doc</tt> directory will build all HTML documentation
throughout the system (other choices are <tt>make world_ps</tt>
for postscript and <tt>make world_all</tt> for both HTML and
postscript).  For convenience, pointers to many of the HTML files
are built into a file called <tt>docPointers</tt> in the
<tt>doc</tt> directory.  There are a series of technical white
papers in the <tt>doc/white-papers</tt> directory.  These can
also be found on the K42 home page
(http://www-stage.watson.ibm.com/K42/index.html).

<p>
Production of the documentation HTML (or postscript) files from the source SGML
files is designed bo be done on a Linux system.  It uses several
tools, including the following RPMs:

<pre>
sgml-common-0.1-10
sgml-tools-1.0.9-8
jadetex-2.7-4
openjade-1.3-6
tetex-fonts-1.0.7-7
tetex-1.0.7-7
tetex-*-1.0.7-7
</pre>

You can probably find these RPMs at http://rpmfind.net
(in particular http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/).

<H2> The Source Code </H2>

The source code itself is located under the <tt>kitchsrc</tt>
directory.  It is largely C++ code, with a smaller number of
C and assembly language files.

<pre>
  File names and counts

    692	*.H      -- C++ header file
    654	*.C      -- C++ code file
    238	Makefile
    184	*.sgml   -- SGML documentation
    143	*.c      -- c code file
    115	*.h      -- c header file
     72	Make.arch
     56	*.ent    
     47	*.S      -- assembly language file
     41	*.fig    -- documentation figure (xfig)
     36	*.tex    -- TeX file
     34	*.eps    -- encapsulated postscript
     28	*.sh     -- shell script
     22	*.src
     20	*.java   -- java source
     11	*.gplt
     11	*.data
     11	*.awk
     10	Make.files
     10	*.raw
     10	*.idraw
      7	*.ps
      4	profile
      4	*.y
      4	*.sty
      4	*.s
      4	*.old
      4	*.conf
      3	TODO
      3	*.scr
      3	*.lds
      3	*.html
      3	*.bib
	...
</pre>

<p> 
The source code should be fairly consistent in style, since the
team has an agreed upon coding style.  In general, code should
be ANSI C++ specifically for the gnu C++ compiler.  We are in 
the process of transitioning from GCC 2.0 to GCC 3.0, so the
code should compile on both.


<H2> Platform Specific Code </H2>

<p>
K42 was designed to be ported to multiple architectures,
initially <tt>powerpc</tt> and <tt>mips64</tt>.  We added
the <tt>amd64</tt> and have partially completed the
<tt>generic64</tt> architectures.  These <tt>TARGET</tt>
architectures have architecture specific code for a number
of functions, such as the low-level hardware operations to
support CPU scheduling and memory management.  

<p>
Architecture
specific changes to the build process (defining architecture
specific files to compile, for example), are put in
<tt>Make.arch</tt> files.  These are included in the
corresponding architecture independent Makefiles. Thus,
the kitchsrc/os/kernel/mem/Makefile will include one of
mem/arch/amd64/Make.arch,
mem/arch/generic64/Make.arch,
mem/arch/mips64/Make.arch, or
mem/arch/powerpc/Make.arch, depending upon the 
target architecture being specified.


<p>
Architecture specific code is kept under an <tt>arch</tt>
directory in the source tree.  Each <tt>arch</tt> directory has a
subdirectory for the architecture specific code for each
supported architecture.  Porting K42 to a new architecture
will involve creating and populating a set of new directories
under <tt>arch</tt> directories.

<p>
The <tt>generic64</tt> port is designed to help with the port
to a new architecture.  The idea of the <tt>generic64</tt>
port is that it defines the interface between the 
architecture independent portion of K42 (most of the code)
and the architecture dependent portion (which needs to be
created for each new port).  The objective is to provide a
clear definition of what needs to be provided for each port.

<p>
To create a new port, in theory, one needs only to define
a new name for your port, copy the generic64 files, changing
all references to generic64 to the name of the new port,
and then fill in the contents of the procedures and methods
in these files.  The size of this task can be approximated
by the number of files in the generic64 directories:

<pre>
     39	*.H
     27	*.C
     17	Make.arch
     13	Makefile
      6	*.c
      5	*.h
      3	*.sgml
      2	*.src
      1	*.ent
      1	*.awk
</pre>

<p>
Many of the architecture specific directories are similar
across the various ports -- examining the other ports can be
very helpful in defining a new port.


<H2> The Build Process </H2>

<p>
The K42 build process is based upon standard GNU make.
Each directory, starting at the top, includes a Makefile.
This Makefile defines a set of make targets which can be
used to build the entire system.  In general, make in
one directory will recursively invoke itself on its
subdirectories to accomplish its task.

<p> 
The objective of the build process is to produce a set of
binaries.  The most important is <tt>boot_image</tt> -- the
bootable image of the K42 kernel.  In addition, there are a
larger set of programs and servers which are created to be run on
K42.

<p>
The build process is designed to allow multiple simultaneous
builds for different target architectures.  The target 
architecture is defined by the ARCHS environment or make
variable.  For example, building the powerpc K42 system
involves:

<pre>
ARCHS=powerpc make         or         make ARCHS=powerpc
</pre>

while building the amd64 K42 system is:

<pre>
ARCHS=amd64 make         or         make ARCHS=amd64
</pre>

<p>
The ARCHS is used to define the TARGET_MACHINE make variable.
This can be used to test in the makefiles for a particular
target architecture.  In addition it is passed to C and C++
as a preprocessor variable, which can be used for #ifdef's.
The structure of K42 has been designed to minimize the 
need for platform specific #ifdef's -- there are only
18 such tests for TARGET_generic64.

<p> 
A separate, but related make variable is the
<tt>PLATFORM</tt> that is supporting the build process itself.
K42 is meant to be cross-compiled -- that is, compiled on one
platform for another target.  Specifically, we normally build
powerpc K42 on AIX, mips64 K42 on IRIX, and amd64 on Linux;
generic64 K42 should build on any platform.  The platform
is determined by the build process as it runs and does not 
need to be explicitly set.  By default, if no TARGET_MACHINE
is specified (with the ARCHS environment variable), the
build environment picks the TARGET_MACHINE base on the
build platform.

<p>
The K42 build divides into three directory trees: the source
(kitchsrc), the install (install), and the object.  The object tree is
defined by the Target architecture and the debug level
(fullDeb, partDeb, noDeb).  For example,
for the PowerPC architecture and the highest level of debugging, the
object tree is powerpc/fullDeb/...  For the mips architecture, and no
debugging, the object tree is mips64/noDeb.  The purpose of this
structure is to allow builds for multiple target architectures from
the same source tree at the same time.

<p> Overall, the source tree is the original input to the build
process.  The source tree is kept in CVS.  Everything can be
built from the source tree (with the exception of the build tool
chain -- gmake, gcc, ...).

<p>
The install tree is used to store the intermediate results of
the build; results which may be used by other parts of the build,
such as header files (install/include) and libraries (install/lib).

<p>
The object tree stores the temporary files that are generated as
the result of a build -- the object files (*.o) and such.  The object
tree is a parallel structure to the source tree -- for each source
directory in the source tree, a directory of the same name is in
the object tree.  The result of compiling a source file, from
the source tree, results in an object file in the parallel object
tree.

<p>
The top-level makefile in the source directory normally drives
everything. There are two main commands at this level:  full_snapshot
and fast_snapshot.  full_snapshot is a full build; fast_snapshot
is used for incremental builds.

<p>
A full build consists of a number of separate, sequential steps.
Each step traverses the entire source tree, with each makefile
invoking make on each of its subdirectories.

<p>
To provide uniformity in the way that the build is performed in each
subdirectory, most of the build is controlled by a common set of
rules.  These rules are defined in kitchsrc/tools/lib/Makerules.kitch
which is "included" into each Makefile.  

<p>
Each Makefile also includes its own local Make.config file.  The
Make.config file defines several makefile variables (_CWD, MKANCHOR,
MKKITCHTOP) which are used in the build process.  The Make.config
files are automatically generated early in the full build (by the
"make configure_sesame" command).

<p>
Makerules.kitch itself "includes" several other files to support
the build process:

<dl>
<dt>
Make.paths
<dd>
define the PLATFORM, MKSRCTOP, MKKITCHTOPP, MKTOOLBIN
	from MKANCHOR.
	defined as a copy of MakePaths.proto or $HOME/.kitchmfinc, 
	defines the OBJDIR_ARCH_TYPES and OBJDIR_OPT_TYPES.

<dt>
Make.config
<dd>
defines (_CWD, MKANCHOR, MKKITCHTOP) for each directory

<dt>
Make.configure
<dd>
defines the rules for building Make.config for each
	source file, as well as the parallel object tree and its Makefiles.

<dt>
Make.arch
<dd>
included if it exists (as arch/TARGET_MACHINE/Make.arch)
	to provide any target-machine dependent build information.

<dt>
Make.help
<dd>
supports "make help"
</dl>


<p>
Makerules.kitch mainly defines all the rules that drive the
build process.  This allows the Makefiles in the various directories
to consist mainly of the definition of makefile variables which
then activate the rules in Makerules.kitch.  For example, the
definition of SUBDIRS will automatically mean that the subdirectories
are recursively called by make for the standard commands: clean,
install_includes, and so on.

<p>
Each directory in the object tree has two basic files: Makefile and
Make.config.  Both of these files are automatically generated during
the "make configure_sesame" step of a full build.  The Makefile
defines several variables which identify it and the parameters
of the build (the TARGET_MACHINE (powerpc, mips64, amd64) and 
OPTIMIZATION (fullDeb, partDeb, noDeb), as well as the path
to the parallel source file directory (SRC_DIR_PATH), and the
top of the build tree (MKANCHOR and MKKITCHTOP).  The Make.config
file in the object tree is identical to the Make.config file
in the source tree.

<p>
The Makefile in the object tree includes Makefile.kitch.  This
"generic" object tree Makefile includes Make.paths, Make.arch, and
all the generated dependency files (*.d).  In addition it includes the
Makefile for this object directory from the corresponding source tree.
Doing so provides all the information about the files to be compiled,
and so on, that is included in the source tree Makefile, but leaves us
still in the object directory.  VPATH is used to allow make to find
the source files (in the source tree) for compilation.

<pre>
VPATH = $(SRC_DIR_PATH):$(SRC_DIR_PATH)arch/$(TARGET_MACHINE) 
</pre>

In addition, of course, including the source Makefile also includes
Makerules.kitch, which provides all the rules for the build.

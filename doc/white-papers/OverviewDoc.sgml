      K42 is an open-source research kernel for cache-coherent 64-bit
      multiprocessor systems.  K42 focuses on achieving good
      performance and scalability, providing a customizable and
      maintainable system, and being accessible to a large community
      through an open source development model.  To that end, K42
      fully supports the Linux API and ABI and uses Linux libraries,
      device drivers, file systems, and other code.  In this paper we
      present a brief overview of K42, describe the goals of K42 and
      the core technologies we used to achieve those goals.  More
      detailed descriptions of specific technologies and OS services
      are available in separate white papers.

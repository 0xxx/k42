This is a list of currently known but not-yet-fixed bugs in K42.

May 1/2000
- the ethernet drivers are not yet working on kitch12, kitch13, and k1 with a 
  single binary.

May 1/2000
- k1 does not boot with 1GB of RAM.

May 1/2000
- random hangs in err_printf()'s have been seen in Kevin's code.

May 1/2000
- random hangs on hardware during boot around initKernelProcess.

May 1/2000
- there is no way of killing a user process.  If it crashes or hangs, you have 
  to reboot.

May 1/2000
- %lld was behaving differently on hardware than it did on the
  simulator before we fixed it by adding the file
  sysdeps/k42/gmp-mparam.h in glibc.  Should look into why there was a
  difference.

May 1/2000
- "XHandleTrans.C:182 XHandleTransTable full" error appears after
  running hardware for a while -- due to token circulation not
  happening.  This is impacting our uptimes.

May 1/2000
- unmap range of a large range hangs in kernel (MP?).

May 1/2000
- PPC doesn't scale on hardware.  Need to look and see why.

May 1/2000
- migrate test with 50 threads causes hangs.  Need to look and see why.

May 1/2000
- wait for 100000 usec to reap process in
  ProcessShared<ALLOC>::startExecuting() and
  ProcessReplicated::startExecuting()
  Slows process creation destroy tests.

May 1/2000
- FileLinux::create() crashes w/ garbage argument (should fail).  Eg,
  "cat" (without an argument) crashes the system.

May 1/2000
- Arguments to PPC calls are not error checked on the server end,
  opening a potential security hole.

May 2/2000
- Alignment handlers are not implemented in K42 yet, meaning that
  4-byte aligned loads/stores to doubles fail if they happen to cross a
  page boundary on PowerPC.

May 2/2000
- In kitch-linux/apps/splash2/codes/apps/barnes/defs.Hm4 there are
  some fields in structs added as a workaround to force doubles to be 8
  byte aligned.  Remove these as soon as the alignment handler is
  implemented.

May 6/2000
- err_printf() is not migration safe, and so if it is called from a
  migratable thread it causes an assert failure in the Scheduler.  This
  assert calls err_printf(), which sets up a nice loop...

May 6/2000
- Thread allocation does not interact well with migration.  If a
  thread is allocated on VP 0, migrates to VP 1, then ends, it leaves a
  thread on the free list of VP 1.  If you repeat this a number of times
  VP 0 may run out of threads (since it is drawing on the fixed pool of
  the ThreadManager) while VP 1 has a large list of free threads.  Some
  mechanism to address this problem needs to be introduced.

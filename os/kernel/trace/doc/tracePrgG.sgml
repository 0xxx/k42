  <title>Tracing</title>
  <para>

    The tracing infrastructure in K42 allows events to be logged to a
    memory buffer.  This buffer in turn can be written to a file or
    out over the network.  There are three steps that need to be
    followed if you would like to add another trace event to an
    already existing sub-system, such as mem, io, proc, etc.  These
    are traceSteps 6-8 as described in <ulink
    url="&topsrc/os/kernel/trace/trace.H"><filename>trace.H:</filename></ulink>.
    Existing sub-systems may be determined by looking in <ulink
    url="&topsrc/os/kernel/trace/traceUtils.H"><filename>traceUtils.H:</filename></ulink>
    where traceStep5d appears.  In most cases, events should be added
    to one of these existing sub-systems.  If a new sub-systems needs
    to be created then follow traceStep1-5 in <ulink
    url="&topsrc/os/kernel/trace/trace.H"><filename>trace.H:</filename></ulink>.

    There are a couple of variables that determine where the kernel
    file gets loaded into memory and the addresses (virtual and
    physical) at which it gets placed.  The real_base, virt_base, and
    load_base in the kernel.scr affect where the file get loaded.  We
    have empircally determined it is best to let the loader/open
    firmware have free reign on where to put the file.  This is done
    by setting these to -1 (oxffffffff).  We then just need to place
    place the kernel high enough in physical memory so the file does
    not conflict with it.  The RELOC variable in the Make.PwrPC
    determines the virtual address the kernel will placed at, and the
    explicit segment statements in the kernel.scr file:

    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[ 
      text PT_LOAD AT (0x110000);
      data PT_LOAD AT (0x130000);
      ]]>
    </programlisting>
    
    determine the physical address the kernel is placed at.  We have
    also found we needed to align the text and data segments to page
    boundaries:
    
    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[
      .text  ALIGN(0x1000) :
      ]]>
    </programlisting>

to get the debugger to work correctly.

Some of those comments specially the last one may apply to amd64...

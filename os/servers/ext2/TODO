Important issues to be done:
- we don't have a buffer cache at all! For now every read/write request
  coming from ext2 results in disc access (i.e, we invoke a method
  of DiskClient)
- we don't implement a list of dirty inodes, and we don't have a thread
  that wakes up to do some cleanup if the list becomes too large.
  __mark_dirty_inode() for now results in an actual disk write


Unacceptable hacks that have to be cleaned up:

- file os/servers/pty/printk.C is being replicated here. Should we move it
  to lib/lk?
  ditto for file os/servers/pty/Util.C

- in the linux tree (linux-026):
    -  there's some replication of stuff on pty/misc.c and fs/misc.c
    -  I've copied core/block.c and core/memory.c into fs/

The following symbols used to be in baseServers from pty.k42lib.o,
but now they're from base.k42lib.o (we want to validate that
pty can be build without fs.k42lib.o, meaning that we don't introduce
undefined symbols?)

(1) Fix authentication scheme

Some preparation work has been done:
By the time we call getFCL(), we either (1) call it with the uid and gid to
be used for the nfs server authentication or (2) we have invoked the
method to acquire credentials, so it's a matter of getting the credentials
to retrieve uid and gid. So NFSClient can keep a mapping of
(uid, gid) into authentication objects, setting the NFSClient instance
to be used accordingly.

This is a small task. Things to keep in mind:
*   some operations are performed for system initialization from baseServers
    before baseServers is running in a linux process; at this point cred is
    NULL and we should use the 'developer' credential (the one we use now
    for everything)
*   later on initialization, baseServers has spawn linux process (for example,
    to read and exec sysinit), but at this point we have 
    uid and gid as 0 in the credentials for this process
*   If we run apps on k42 that add users, these users may not have
    equivalent ones in the nfs server side. This is a rare case, so we
    probably could add the users. If the user id being created corresponds
    to an existing, unrelated, user on the other side, we don't care.

  <title>NFS Environment Variables</title>
  <para>
    NFS presently needs two environment variables to function properly.
  </para>

  <para>
    K42_NFS_ROOT = hostname:rootpathname
  </para>

  <para>
    K42_NFS_ID = uid:gid
  </para>

  <para>
    These variables are set by kthinwire script with help from knfsroot
    script.  Presently, knfsroot sets the hostname component of
    K42_NFS_ROOT to the localhost.
  </para>

  <para>
    One can choose the hostname for the K42_NFS_ROOT environment variable
    by defining the K42_NFS_HOST environment variable. Currently, this
    should be assigned as a; dotted ip address (192.168.1.1), not a
    standard machine "hostname".
  </para>

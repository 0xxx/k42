    These servers are currently dowloaded automatically as part of the
    kernel image:

  </para>

  <para>
    Actually, the shell, userProc, and sample servers are not really
    servers, but are programs that are automatically downloaded with the
    kernel image, so that they can be started up cheaply.  The only real
    server here, is baseServer, which incorporates all the servers needed
    to boot the system, and which is automatically started by the kernel.

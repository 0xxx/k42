This directory contains a tool to convert K42 trace files to an LTT
(Linux Trace Toolkit) approximation in order to use the LTT visualiser
program on K42 traces.

Since this tool includes LTT and Linux headers (LTTTypes.h,
ltt-linuxevents.h, linux-ppc64-unistd.h), it is licensed under the GPL,
rather than the LGPL that covers most of K42.

LTT expects as well as a trace file, a proc file which contains info about
the process IDs and IRQ numbers on the system. K42 doesn't yet have the
interfaces to extract this information, so you have to supply it manually.
The ltt-procfile file contains an example procfile for a basic K42 boot on
a Power3 box. If you don't care about the visualiser displaying process
and IRQ names, it's also sufficient to supply an empty file.

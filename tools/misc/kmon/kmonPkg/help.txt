Overview:

    After opening a trace file the view in the graphics represents a
    timeline showing all the events in the file in time increasing order.
    As trace files may contain many more events than could be individually
    shown at a given resolution kmon chooses to represent the color and
    height of each vertical pixel as follows.  It will count all the events
    that map to a given pixel at the current zoom resolution.  If only one
    event maps to the given pixel a full height bar will be shown.  If more
    than one event maps to that pixel but all from the same display entity
    a 3/4 bar will be shown.  If events from more than one display entity
    map to a given pixel then a 1/2 height bar will be shown with the color
    being unspecified by normally the last event in time that would map to
    that pixel.

Display Entities:

    Currently the only way of choosing colors is by CDAs or CommID.  CDAs
    correspond to domains in K42 and communication ids or CommIDs may
    currently be used instead of PIDs.  In the future PIDs will be able to
    be set as a display entity as well.  All these choices are available
    under the Show menu.  Additionally the color that is being used to
    display each entity may be changed to highlight a display entity of
    interest.


Colors: The kernel is always represented by default as red and the idle
    loop is represented by default as blue.  Other display entities are
    assigned from a rotating color scheme not including blue or red.  Their
    colors (as well as the kernel and idle loop) may be set by choosing the
    CommID choice from the Show menu.


Scrolling:

    Clicking the arrow keys in the scroll bar moves the screen 1/4 of the
    way to the right or left.  Clicking in the scroll bar to the right or
    left of indicator will move a full screen in that direction.

Zooming:

    There are many options for zooming using the zoom menu.  Most are
    reasonably obvious.  At a given zoom range you can set a mark.  The
    begin and end time will be remembered.  At any future time, until the
    set zoom mark option is chosen again, choosing to zoom mark will zoom
    back into the time range that was displayed when set zoom mark was
    executed.
	
    To zoom using the mouse left click on the beginning time and right
    click on the ending time, then middle clicking will zoom into the time
    range specified by the two lines drawn when the let and mouse button
    were clicked.  Successive clicks of the left and right mouse bottom
    toggle the begin and end line respectively.
	

Text Display Box:

    The text display box can be used to show statistics for the time range
    of events being displayed in the graph, can be used to display
    execution or lock stats if tied in with traceProfile.  This can be used
    to connect the tool to Eclipse.

    The text box below the main graph can also be used to view the actual
    trace events.  This can be activated by clicking the middle button in
    the graph at the place where event is desired.  While viewing event,
    ctrl-b and ctrl-f or the left and right arrow may be used to move
    forward and backward by events.


Showing Events:

    The kmon tool will display or highlight specific events.  This option
    is initiated by choosing Show Event from the Show menu.  The tool is
    integrated with the K42 performance monitoring infrastructure and will
    provide a dialog window allowing the user to choose the event and color
    with which to display that event.  All events in the given time display
    range will be placed on the graph and a count of the events will be
    displayed.  A common example may be to mark process start event with
    green and process terminate with red to show when processes start and
    stop.

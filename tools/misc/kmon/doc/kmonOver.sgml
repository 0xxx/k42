  <title>traceTool</title>
  <para>
    traceTool takes as input a filename.  This should be a binary trace
    file generated by k42.  If the tool is run without a filename given it
    will query the user for one once it starts.  The tool generates on
    standard output an ascii - human-readable format as determined by the
    strings programmers entered when they wrote each of the trace events.
    This strings may be found in kernel/trace/traceXXX.H and
    libc/trace/traceXXX.H files.  This tool will zero base the time for the
    file so that the first event occurs at 0 seconds.  It calculates time
    by reading the ticks per second from the header of the trace file.  The
    tool can also be used to print out all the majorIDs, minorIDs, and
    other trace info available in the system.  This is accomplished by
    giving the -dump option

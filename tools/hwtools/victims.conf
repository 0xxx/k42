# This is not a Makefile, but Makefile-mode for emacs is appropriate
#

# Each victim can have any arbitrary (field,value) pair, as necessary
# to support the tools and environment for that victim machine.  Here
# are some of the fields used by the ktwd/thinwire/hwconsole tools.
# Where indicated, some fields are used only by site-specific tools,
# and may not be applicable for other victims/sites
#
#
# The syntax for specifying these is:
# victim.field = value
#

# A victim may specify an "inherit" field, which identifies a parent
# set of field values that are searched if the field being sought does
# not exist in the victims set of field values.
#
# Multiple inherit field values are seperated by commas.
#
#
# For an inheritance tree such as this:
#
# (A has:  A.inherit =B,C
#
#             A
#            / \
#           B   C
#          / \ / \
#          D E F G
#
# The search order is: A B C D E F G
# Once a field value is found, any subsequent definitions are ignored
#
#
# Any key (victim name) that begins with "_" is not considered a valid
# victim, but rather as a set of fields and values that can be
# inherited as a group by a victim.
#
# This inheritance mechanism allows one to define a set of common
# values (perhaps site-specific values or machine-type specific
# values) that can be easily associated with victims.

# Some usefull value names
#
# K42_IP_ADDRESS= IP address of victim

# K42_IP_ROUTER	= IP gateway for victim to use

# K42_IP_NETMASK= IP netmask for victim to use

# kinstall	= name of command to install a bootable image used as:
#		  <kinstall> <image> <victim>

# ktw		= serial port which is connected to victim

# kserial	= machine that host serial connection to victim

# outlet	= outlet on power bar (watson reboot script)

# kpower	= power bar name (watson reboot script)

# reboot	= name of command invoked to reboot victim invoked as:
#		  <reboot> <victim name>

# site		= site of victim 

# TW_BASE_PORT	= base port number for thinwire

# fs_disks	= mount specification for disk file-systems

# sync_cmd	= Name of a script that is executed and hwconsole waits
#		  to receive a 0 return code before proceeding.
#		  This is expected to perform locking functions and is 
#		  thus invoked with arguments of the form:
#		  sync_cmd <victim> <breaklocks> <lockmsg>

# async_cmd	= Name of a script that hwconsole executes in the background.
#		  Name of victim is sole argument. kvictim values for specified
#		  victim can be retrieved from the environment.

# sync_cmd	= Name of a script that hwconsole executes in the foreground
#		  termination of this process results in hwconsole killing
#		  all other processes it has started.
#		  Name of victim is sole argument. kvictim values for specified
#		  victim can be retrieved from the environment.

include generic_hw.conf

# The build process will add a line similar to:
# include watson.conf
#
# This will include a site-specific configuration.

<title> thinwire overview </title>

<para>Thinwire is a technique to multiplex multiple communications
channels over a single serial line (or emulated serial line)
to a set of sockets.  Since sockets are a fundamental part of
a Unix environment, the remote end can be on either the local
machine, or on a remote machine.</para>

<para>
In a hardware case, you need a serial line from the client
machine to a server machine.  With the simos and mambo
simulators, the simulator automatically routes the bits to the
socket "localhost:2101".  The "2101" designation is the default
port value, and can be overridden by the K42_SIMULATOR_PORT
environment variable to simos/mambo.</para>

<para>
Running on the thinwire server machine, is the thinwire server
program.  The thinwire server takes the input stream that comes
from the thinwire victim and breaks it up into multiple channels
-- each channel is redirected to a different socket.  At the
other end of the socket is a "client" program that provides
services for the victim.</para>

<para>
Figure 1 illustrates how thinwire is used:
</para>

<screen>
|--------|     |----------| <--- channel 0 (Console)
|        |     |          | <--- channel 1 (gdb)
| victim |<----| thinwire | <--- channel 2 (simip)
|        |     |          | <--- channel 3  ...
|--------|     |----------| <--- ...
</screen>

<para>
By default simos and mambo use port 2101 for the communication
between the thinwire victim (K42, for example), and the thinwire
server.  Port 2102 is used to talk to the program for channel 0;
port 2103 for the next channel, 2104 for the next (simip), and so
on.</para>

<para>
The client programs may be run on either the local machine or on
a remote machine.  The thinwire server is told where the victim
is.  The client programs are told where thinwire is.  Thus
for any given client program, we have 3 possible machines:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>the victim machine -- v_host</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>the thinwire server machine  -- t_host</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>the client machine </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

Any (or all of these can be "localhost" to indicate that 
the two programs are on the same machine.</para>

<para>
When the various pieces are started, they must be told what
machine and port to use.  These port numbers are defined either
by command line arguments or environment variables.</para>

<para>
To start a system running:
</para>

<procedure>
<step>
<para>Start thinwire.  Give it the name of the machine that
mambo will be running on and ports for the thinwire victim
(simos/mambo) as well as those that you want to use for the
console, gdb, and simip:

<screen>
> thinwire v_host:2101 2102 2103 2104 2105 2106
</screen>
</para>
</step>

<step>
<para>
Start console.  

<screen>
> console t_host:2102
</screen>
</para>
</step>

<step>
<para>
Start simip.  simip uses two sockets to communicate with thinwire.

<screen>
> simip t_host:2104 t_host:2106
</screen>
</para>
</step>

<step>
<para>
Start mambo (or simos) and boot the K42 kernel.
</para>
</step>
</procedure>

<para>
Incidentally, thinwire's first argument when talking to a
hardware victim is the serial device to use rather than a
host:port combination.  On Windows boxes the first argument is
something like "com1:", while on Linux it is something like
"/dev/tty0"
